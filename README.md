# Turn_Based_Board_Game

This is a project used to learn about turn-based board game.
The concept will revolve around statues acting as player and enemy interacting with each other on a grid-based board.
The goal is to reach the goal point on the point (represented as an object with its position revealed) whilst avoiding traps and enemies
The project will feature:
+ Turn-based gameplay alternating between player controlling a character and enemies trying to attack the player
+ A battle system where each character is limited with action points (or moves)
+ Level design tool using JSON file format (.txt) to save design and load design into scene
+ Elevation in map design and character (and AI) movement (A*)
+ Limited 3d lighting surrounding the player, acting as (3d?) fog of war (NOT YET)
+ A variety of enemies, traps, gimmicks, abilities  (NOT YET)
+ Save system  (NOT YET)
